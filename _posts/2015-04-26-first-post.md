title: Hello there!

I finally did it. Here it is! As homemade as I can get, this blog is built with Jekyll and hosted on GitHub Pages.

My primary purpose of this blog? There are just too many thoughts in my head, happenings in my day, _stuff_ in the world that I need to document as much as possible for future recollection. The kinds of posts I plan to make will evolve around my growth as a programmer but really... just my general musings.
My domain - anything goes!
