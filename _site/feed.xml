        <title>Hello there!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I finally did it. Here it is! As homemade as I can get, this blog is built with Jekyll and hosted on GitHub Pages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My primary purpose of this blog? There are just too many thoughts in my head, happenings in my day, &lt;em&gt;stuff&lt;/em&gt; in the world that I need to document as much as possible for future recollection. The kinds of posts I plan to make will evolve around my growth as a programmer but really... just my general musings.
My domain - anything goes!&lt;/p&gt;
